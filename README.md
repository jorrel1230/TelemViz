Step 1: Turn on Backend Locally
  - cd ./server 
  - Activate Python Virtual Env
      -> source ./venv/bin/activate (MacOS)
      -> ./venv/Scripts/activate (Windows)
  - Run server.py
      -> python3 server.py (MacOS)
      -> python server.py (Windows)
    
Step 2: Turn on Frontend Locally
  - cd ./client
  - npm install
  - npm run preview
  
Note: This Dashboard is not deployable. It can only be run locally as the backend requires a physical connection.
